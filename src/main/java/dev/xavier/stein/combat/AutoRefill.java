/**
 * Auto Refill: when the inventory's armor spares run out (or fall below the target, in constant
 * mode), sends the server's virtual chest command ("/bau vip"), waits for the chest to open and
 * brings the armor into the bag — with the chest screen hidden (the player keeps playing) or in
 * view, as the player chooses.
 *
 * <p>One step every 100 ms, and every step ends with the cursor empty (Smart Effect may touch the
 * inventory in between). Bringing is: with a free space in the bag, pick from the chest and drop
 * there; with a worn piece in the bag (and "return worn pieces" on, or the bag full), <b>swap</b> —
 * the chest's piece goes where the worn one was and the worn one goes to its place in the chest,
 * three clicks. Swapping is what works with a full chest and a full bag. With nothing to bring, the
 * leftover worn pieces go to the chest, if they fit.
 *
 * <p>The rules are Auto Armor's for each piece ({@link ArmorSlots}): only the pieces turned on, the
 * enchantment filter, and the protection priority (highest or lowest first); worn is at the rule's
 * durability threshold.
 *
 * <p>It works with Auto Armor on or not: it only reads the rules, which apply even with Auto Armor
 * off. Together, Auto Armor puts on and the refill restocks the bag; alone, the refill only keeps
 * the bag stocked with spares.
 *
 * <p>Three modes: when a piece's spares run out, constant (keeps the target spares per piece) and
 * on key — then Auto Refill does not stay on: the key (or the Panel button) makes one trip to the
 * chest right away, up to the target, and it turns itself off at the end.
 *
 * <p><b>Checked with the server</b>, as in Auto Armor: the client applies each click at once, and a
 * click the server silently refuses would leave the client thinking it brought what it did not. So:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>each step checks its own result; three steps in a row with no effect ask for the window's
 *       real contents (Inventory.resync) and wait for them before going on;
 *   <li>before closing, if there was a click since the last check, it checks once more — if the
 *       server undid something, the work goes on;
 *   <li>an item left on the cursor (a click refused in the middle of a swap) goes back to a free
 *       place in the next step;
 *   <li>after closing, the bag is checked with the server (the player's window);
 *   <li>nothing gets stuck: the checks per trip are capped, the trip has a maximum time, and trips
 *       that fail in a row wait longer and longer before the next.
 * </ul>
