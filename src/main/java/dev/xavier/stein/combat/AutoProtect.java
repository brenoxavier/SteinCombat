/**
 * Auto Protect: the sword blocking by itself. Two parts, each with its own switch, under Auto
 * Protect's switch:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Block in menus</b>: with a screen open (inventory, chat, Panel), the sword in hand and
 *       blocking — whoever handles the inventory in the middle of a fight does not stand there with
 *       the arm down;
 *   <li><b>Low health block</b>: with health at the limit ({@link CombatConfig#protectLowHealth})
 *       in a fight, the sword blocking until health is back ({@link
 *       CombatConfig#protectResumeHealth}). While blocking the hit does not go out — the game does
 *       not hit with an item in use, nor with the autoclick —, so at close range the player stops
 *       taking mcMMO's counterattack (which returns the damage of whoever hits) and takes half the
 *       damage of whoever hits them.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>How "Low health block" behaves</b>, with two health marks (hysteresis):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>enters with health at the low mark or below, in a fight (damage in the last 3 seconds or an
 *       enemy — neither ally nor in my clan — within 6 blocks) and with a sword in the inventory;
 *   <li>once in, stays until health reaches the high mark (or the maximum health, if lower).
 *       Meanwhile the sword blocks while there is a fight, and Smart Effect's Speed and Strength
 *       wait — health first, then the potions. With no fight (the enemy left), the sword goes down
 *       — the player can run away —, but the potions keep waiting for health;
 *   <li>the player switched hotbar slots in the middle of blocking (wheel or number key): they are
 *       in charge — the sword goes down for 3 seconds, and comes back after that if health is still
 *       low.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The order with the rest</b> (the hand and the use key have a single owner, {@link
 * SmartEffect}, which asks here what to do): armor (Auto Armor), Regeneration (the apple), the
 * blocking from here, and only then Speed and Strength. Regeneration comes before blocking: eating
 * the apple is what brings health back, and blocking is what holds until it comes. When
 * Regeneration is missing, the sword goes down to eat and blocks again at the end. Auto Refill does
 * not touch the hand (only the bag, through the virtual chest) and goes on alongside; with its
 * chest open, the sword is only looked for on the hotbar.
