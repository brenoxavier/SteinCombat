/**
 * Auto Armor: replaces and swaps armor by itself, every tick, with the same clicks a player makes —
 * without opening the inventory, without pausing, without holding the player. It works with the
 * inventory open or closed, in the Esc menu, in the chat, in the Panel: the player's own inventory
 * window exists all the time. The only exception is an open container (chest, furnace, crafting
 * table): the server only accepts clicks in its window, which has no armor slots; when it closes,
 * Auto Armor acts in the same tick.
 *
 * <p>Each piece follows a rule ({@link Rule}) — the same for all in simple mode, or one per piece:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>mode</b>: off; <b>replace when broken</b> (lets it break and puts the spare on in the
 *       tick the slot empties); <b>swap before</b> (with durability at the threshold or below it
 *       swaps for a spare that has more, and replaces it if it breaks anyway);
 *   <li><b>priority</b>: the spare with the highest protection first, or the lowest (use up the
 *       weak ones first);
 *   <li><b>unenchanted</b>: whether an unenchanted spare is accepted (off by default).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A piece's protection ({@link #score}) counts everything: the material's armor points,
 * Protection, the specific protections and Unbreaking. The remaining durability only counts if the
 * rule asks ({@link Rule#durability}), and only as a tie-breaker between pieces that protect the
 * same; after it, the bag comes before the hotbar.
 *
 * <p>The shift-click is only for an empty slot (the piece broke). With the piece still on, a swap
 * that never leaves the body without it: a spare on the hotbar goes on with the number key over the
 * armor slot (one packet); one in the bag, with the three clicks of a swap (the new one takes the
 * old one's place and the old one goes where the new one was). Whatever goes through the cursor
 * waits for it to be empty (the player may be holding an item in the inventory).
 *
 * <p><b>Checked with the server.</b> The client applies the click at once; if the server refuses it
 * without sending the slot back (a plugin that cancels the click, an anticheat, lag), the client
 * keeps showing armor the server does not have — and Auto Armor, which only sees the client, thinks
 * all is well. With many hits landing, the durability the server sends for the old piece can also
 * arrive after the click and put it back in the slot, on the client. So in the same tick as the
 * swap, right after its clicks, the real inventory is asked from the server ({@link
 * Inventory#resync}): the server answers after applying the swap, with the right state. Until the
 * answer, the swapped piece is not swapped again (an empty slot is still filled, and the other
 * pieces go on); with it, the swap counts as done or refused. Swapping the same piece again soon
 * after (armor running out fast in a fight) is not a refusal: only the server's answer decides. A
 * piece refused several times in a row waits longer and longer between attempts, without ever
 * stopping for good, and each attempt changes the way of swapping (the fallback, see {@link
 * #swap}). Taking hits while the worn armor's durability does not move is a sign of a client out of
 * step with the server too.
